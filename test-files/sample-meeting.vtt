<v Sarah Chen>Alright everyone, let's get started. Today we're going to discuss the Q1 roadmap and the Enrollment API migration.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Marcus Webb>Thanks Sarah. So the main question is whether we can maintain backward compatibility through Q1 while we roll out v2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Patrick>I've looked at the downstream consumers. We have about 15 active integrations. I think we need at least 8 weeks notice.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Sarah Chen>Let's decide to keep v1 available through end of Q1. Marcus, can you audit all the downstream consumers by next Friday?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Marcus Webb>Sure, I can do that. I'll also check with the mobile team about their migration timeline.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Patrick>Great. I'll draft the deprecation timeline by January 20th. We should prioritize mobile clients for v2 support.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Sarah Chen>Agreed. Let's also use feature flags for the gradual rollout. I'll schedule a partner communication sync for next week.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Marcus Webb>One more thing - should we consider the Project Alpha integration? They're our biggest API consumer.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Sarah Chen>Good point. Patrick, can you reach out to the Project Alpha team directly?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Patrick>Will do. I'll set up a call with Jordan from their team this week.
