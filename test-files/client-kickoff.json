      "text": "Thanks everyone for joining. This is our kickoff meeting for the Acme Corp website redesign project. I want to make sure we're all aligned on scope, timeline, and deliverables. Jennifer, can you start by giving us an overview of what Acme is looking for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jennifer Walsh",
      "start_time": 20,
      "end_time": 55,
      "text": "Absolutely. So Acme Corp wants a complete redesign of their marketing website. The main goals are improving conversion rates, mobile responsiveness, and updating the brand to feel more modern. They've given us a budget of $75,000 and want to launch by end of Q1. Their CEO is particularly focused on the homepage and pricing page experiences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tom Chen",
      "start_time": 55,
      "end_time": 85,
      "text": "That timeline is tight but doable. For the technical side, are we rebuilding from scratch or working with their existing CMS? Also, do they need any integrations - CRM, analytics, that sort of thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jennifer Walsh",
      "start_time": 85,
      "end_time": 110,
      "text": "They want to move to a new CMS - they're currently on WordPress but want something more modern. I'd recommend we propose Webflow or a headless CMS. For integrations, definitely HubSpot for their CRM and they mentioned wanting better analytics than what they have now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rachel Green",
      "start_time": 110,
      "end_time": 140,
      "text": "For the design side, do we have brand guidelines to work from? And how many unique page templates are we looking at? That'll really affect my timeline for the mockups."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jennifer Walsh",
      "start_time": 140,
      "end_time": 165,
      "text": "They have basic brand guidelines but they're open to refreshing the visual identity. I'd say about 8 to 10 unique templates - homepage, about, pricing, product pages, blog, contact, careers, and a few landing page variants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patrick",
      "start_time": 165,
      "end_time": 200,
      "text": "Okay let's make some decisions. First, CMS - I think Webflow makes sense given the timeline and their team's technical level. Tom, do you agree? Second, we need to decide on the project phases."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tom Chen",
      "start_time": 200,
      "end_time": 225,
      "text": "Webflow works for me. It'll speed up development significantly. For phases, I'd suggest: Phase 1 is discovery and design - 3 weeks. Phase 2 is development of core pages - 4 weeks. Phase 3 is remaining pages and integrations - 3 weeks. Phase 4 is testing and launch - 2 weeks."

    {
      "speaker": "Rachel Green",
      "start_time": 225,
      "end_time": 250,
      "text": "That works for design. I can have initial homepage concepts ready within the first week and a half. Full mockups for all templates by end of week 3. I'll need the brand refresh decision made by end of this week though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patrick",
      "start_time": 250,
      "end_time": 285,
      "text": "Perfect. Let's lock that in. Decision made - we're going with Webflow and the 12-week timeline Tom proposed. Jennifer, can you draft the SOW and send it to Acme by Friday? Tom, start setting up the Webflow workspace. Rachel, schedule a brand workshop with their team for early next week."
