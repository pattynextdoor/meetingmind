      "start_time": 0,
      "end_time": 20,
      "text": "Thanks for jumping on short notice everyone. We've hit a significant blocker and I want to address it before it derails our timeline. Marcus, can you explain what you found?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marcus Webb",
      "start_time": 20,
      "end_time": 65,
      "text": "So I was doing load testing on the user-service yesterday and discovered a major issue. Under load, the PostgreSQL connections are exhausting. We're configured for a max of 20 connections but during peak simulation we need way more. The connection pooling isn't working as expected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alex Rivera",
      "start_time": 65,
      "end_time": 95,
      "text": "Is this a configuration issue or something architectural? Because if we need to change how services connect to the database, that affects my deployment setup too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marcus Webb",
      "start_time": 95,
      "end_time": 130,
      "text": "It's a bit of both. The ORM we're using creates a new connection pool per service instance. With Kubernetes scaling up pods, we're multiplying connections. I'm thinking we need PgBouncer as a connection pooler in front of PostgreSQL."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alex Rivera",
      "start_time": 130,
      "end_time": 155,
      "text": "I can add PgBouncer to the cluster. That's actually a standard pattern - should have thought of it earlier. I'll need about a day to set it up and test. Marcus, can you update the connection strings once it's ready?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marcus Webb",
      "start_time": 155,
      "end_time": 175,
      "text": "Definitely. While you're doing that, I'll refactor the connection handling code to be more efficient. We're also not closing connections properly in some error paths - found that during debugging."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jordan Kim",
      "start_time": 175,
      "end_time": 200,
      "text": "Does this affect the frontend at all? I'm about to start the billing integration which makes a lot of API calls. Don't want to build something that's going to break under load."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marcus Webb",
      "start_time": 200,
      "end_time": 225,
      "text": "It shouldn't affect your work directly Jordan, but hold off on the billing integration until Thursday. By then we'll have PgBouncer running and I'll have the fixes deployed. Don't want you debugging issues that are actually backend problems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah Chen",
      "start_time": 225,
      "end_time": 260,
      "text": "Good call. Jordan, use the time to finish the component library documentation instead - we've been putting that off. This blocker costs us about 2 days but I think we can absorb it. We had some buffer built in for exactly these kinds of issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jordan Kim",
      "start_time": 260,
      "end_time": 280,
      "text": "Makes sense. I'll document the components and also set up Storybook so we have visual documentation. Been meaning to do that anyway."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alex Rivera",
      "start_time": 280,
      "end_time": 310,
      "text": "One more thing - should we add database monitoring to catch these issues earlier? I can set up PgHero or similar. Would give us visibility into slow queries, connection counts, that kind of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah Chen",
      "start_time": 310,
      "end_time": 340,
      "text": "Yes, absolutely. Add that to your list Alex. We need better observability - this issue would have been caught earlier with proper monitoring. Let's make that a priority."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marcus Webb",
      "start_time": 340,
      "end_time": 365,
      "text": "Agreed. I'll also add some connection pool metrics to our health endpoints so Datadog can track them. We should alert if we get above 80% pool utilization."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah Chen",
      "start_time": 365,
      "end_time": 400,
      "text": "Perfect. So to summarize: Alex sets up PgBouncer by tomorrow, Marcus fixes connection handling and adds metrics, Jordan focuses on documentation and Storybook. Let's reconvene Thursday to verify the fix. I'll update the stakeholders that we have a minor delay but it's under control. Thanks for the quick response everyone."
