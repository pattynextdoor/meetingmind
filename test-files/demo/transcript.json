      "text": "Alright, let's get into it. We're three weeks out from the Cadence app launch and I want to make sure we're all aligned. Chris, where are we on the core features?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Park",
      "start_time": 22,
      "end_time": 52,
      "text": "Good news—the notification system is done, push notifications are working on both iOS and Android. The onboarding flow is about 90% there. Main blocker right now is the OAuth integration with Google. I've been going back and forth with their API docs and it's... not fun."

      "start_time": 68,
      "end_time": 95,
      "text": "It's the refresh token handling. Their documentation says one thing, the actual behavior is different. I think I need another day, maybe two. If I'm still stuck Friday, I'll post in the Google developer forums."

      "end_time": 125,
      "text": "On the design side, all the screens are finalized. I handed off the last batch to Chris yesterday—the settings screens and the empty states. One thing I want to flag: I think we should add a quick tutorial overlay for first-time users. Nothing crazy, just three or four slides explaining the main features."

      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",

      "start_time": 145,
      "end_time": 165,
      "text": "If Aisha gets me the designs by Monday, I can have it done by Wednesday. It's pretty straightforward—just a modal with swipeable pages."

      "speaker": "Aisha Patel",
      "start_time": 165,
      "end_time": 178,

      "speaker": "Derek Nguyen",
      "start_time": 178,
      "end_time": 215,
      "text": "Quick marketing update. The landing page is live, we've got about 400 people on the waitlist so far. I've been running some early ads on Instagram and the cost per signup is around two dollars, which is pretty solid for this category. I want to ramp up spend next week as we get closer to launch."

      "start_time": 238,
      "end_time": 268,
      "text": "We've got five thousand left in the launch budget. I'm thinking we do a bigger push the day before and day of launch. Also want to reach out to a few tech reviewers—I've got a list of YouTubers and newsletter folks who cover productivity apps."

      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 268,
      "end_time": 295,
      "text": "Love it. Let's make sure we have a press kit ready for those reviewers. Aisha, can you put together some screenshots, the app icon, maybe a short description they can copy-paste?"

      "speaker": "Aisha Patel",
      "start_time": 295,

      "start_time": 310,
      "end_time": 340,
      "text": "One more thing—we need to decide on the pricing. Are we doing freemium or a free trial? The App Store submission is going to ask, and I need to set up the in-app purchase stuff ahead of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 340,
      "end_time": 375,
      "text": "Good call. I've been thinking about this. My vote is freemium—free tier with basic features, then $5 a month for premium. The notification scheduling and team features would be premium. Derek, what do you think from a marketing angle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Derek Nguyen",
      "start_time": 375,
      "end_time": 408,
      "text": "Freemium works better for growth. Lower barrier to entry, easier to get people in the door. We can always convert them later. I'd also suggest a yearly option at like $40—gives people a discount and us better retention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 408,
      "end_time": 435,
      "text": "Alright, decision made. Freemium model: free basic tier, $5 monthly or $40 yearly for premium. Chris, set that up in App Store Connect and Google Play. Anything else before we wrap?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Aisha Patel",
      "start_time": 435,
      "end_time": 455,
      "text": "Just the app store screenshots. I'll need a day or two after Chris has the final build to capture everything."

      "start_time": 455,
      "end_time": 472,
      "text": "I can get you a release candidate by next Tuesday. That gives you Wednesday and Thursday to do screenshots."

    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 472,
      "end_time": 510,
      "text": "Perfect. Let me recap the action items. Chris: finish OAuth by Friday, tutorial feature by next Wednesday, release candidate by next Tuesday, and set up in-app purchases. Aisha: tutorial designs by Monday, press kit by Thursday, app store screenshots by next Friday. Derek: ramp up ads next week and start reviewer outreach. We're in good shape, team. Let's crush this launch."
