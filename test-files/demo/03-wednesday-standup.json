    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Quick check-in. How's everyone doing?"},
    {"speaker": "Priya Sharma", "text": "Metrics Dashboard is coming along. Marcus helped me with the websocket issue yesterday. Now I'm blocked on getting test data—need access to the staging environment."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "I can help with that. Also, my Checkout Service PR is up for review. Would love eyes on it."},
    {"speaker": "Patrick Tumbucon", "text": "I'll take a look this afternoon. Been diving into the auth middleware code—I think I have some ideas for the Auth Token Refresh Bug."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "That's great to hear, Patrick. Marcus, want to sync with Patrick after this to discuss?"},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Definitely. The issue is trickier than I thought—it's in how we're handling refresh tokens across microservices. Would be great to get fresh eyes on it."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Alright, keep me posted. That's a blocker for the Platform Migration if we don't fix it before Q2."},
    {"speaker": "Priya Sharma", "text": "Quick question—should the Metrics Dashboard show auth-related metrics? Might help us catch issues like this earlier."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Great idea. Let's add that to the backlog. Patrick, as you're looking at auth, keep Priya's dashboard in mind for what metrics would be useful."}
