      "end_time": 85,
      "text": "I think we need both. Basic search should work immediately - like typing 'pricing discussion' and finding all meetings where that was mentioned. But we should also support filters - by date range, participants, tags. And maybe even semantic search eventually."

      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 190,
      "end_time": 225,
      "text": "Definitely include transcript content. That's where the real value is - finding that one meeting where someone mentioned a specific feature or decision. But we should highlight which part matched."

      "start_time": 225,
