      "text": "Alright team, we're one week post-launch. Let's do a quick retrospective - what went well, what didn't, and what we'd do differently. I'll start."

      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 30,
      "end_time": 65,
      "text": "What went well: The launch was smooth. No major bugs in production. The onboarding flow worked really well - we're seeing 85% completion rate. And Derek's marketing push got us great initial traction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 65,
      "end_time": 95,
      "text": "What didn't go well: We underestimated the server load on launch day. Had to scale up quickly. Also, the payment flow had a small UX issue that confused some users - we fixed it, but it shouldn't have shipped."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Park",
      "start_time": 95,
      "end_time": 135,
      "text": "From engineering side, I'm happy with how stable everything is. The OAuth integration that gave us trouble early on ended up being rock solid. What I'd change: I wish we'd done more load testing before launch. That server scaling issue could have been avoided."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Aisha Patel",
      "start_time": 135,
      "end_time": 175,
      "text": "Design-wise, the feedback has been really positive. Users love the onboarding tutorial. But I do think we could have done more user testing on the payment flow - that UX issue Chris mentioned was something we could have caught earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Derek Nguyen",
      "start_time": 175,
      "end_time": 210,
      "text": "Marketing launch exceeded expectations. We hit 2,000 signups in the first week. The App Store featuring helped a lot. What I'd do differently: I wish we'd prepared more content ahead of time - blog posts, case studies. We're playing catch-up now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 210,
      "end_time": 245,
      "text": "Good points everyone. Let's capture some action items. First, we need to establish better load testing practices. Chris, can you document our current infrastructure and create a load testing plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Park",
      "start_time": 245,
      "end_time": 270,
      "text": "Yeah, I'll have that done by next week. I'll also set up better monitoring so we catch these issues earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 270,
      "end_time": 300,
      "text": "Second, we should formalize our user testing process. Aisha, can you create a lightweight process we can follow for future features?"

      "speaker": "Aisha Patel",
      "start_time": 300,
      "end_time": 325,
      "text": "Absolutely. I'll draft something this week. Maybe 2-3 user tests per major feature before we ship."

      "speaker": "Maya Rodriguez",
      "start_time": 325,
      "end_time": 355,
      "text": "And Derek, let's plan content ahead of time for future launches. Can you create a content calendar template?"

      "speaker": "Derek Nguyen",
      "start_time": 355,
      "end_time": 380,
      "text": "For sure. I'll create a template and start planning content for the next feature release."
