    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Alright, let's do a quick round. Priya, you want to start?"},
    {"speaker": "Priya Sharma", "text": "Sure. I'm still working on the Metrics Dashboard redesign. Hit a snag with the real-time charts—need to talk to Marcus about the websocket connection."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Yeah, happy to sync on that. On my end, the Checkout Service refactor is going well. Got the new payment flow working locally. Should have a PR up by end of day."},
    {"speaker": "Riley O'Brien", "text": "Quick heads up—the CI pipeline is running slow again. I've been investigating the CI Pipeline Slowdown issue. Looks like it's the test parallelization config. Should have a fix today."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Good. The Platform Migration is still on track for the Q2 launch. Marcus, make sure the Checkout Service changes are compatible with the new architecture."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Will do. I'll coordinate with Riley on the deployment strategy."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Perfect. Anything blocking anyone? No? Alright, let's get to it."}
