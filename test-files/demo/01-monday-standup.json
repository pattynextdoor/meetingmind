    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Alright, let's do a quick round. Patrick, welcome to your first standup! Why don't you introduce yourself, then we'll go around."},
    {"speaker": "Patrick Tumbucon", "text": "Thanks! I'm Patrick, just joined as a senior engineer. Excited to be here. Still getting oriented, but looking forward to diving in."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Great to have you. Priya, you want to go next?"},

    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Yeah, happy to sync on that. On my end, the Checkout Service refactor is going well. Got the new payment flow working locally. Should have a PR up by end of day."},
    {"speaker": "Riley O'Brien", "text": "Quick heads up—the CI pipeline is running slow again. I've been investigating the CI Pipeline Slowdown issue. Looks like it's the test parallelization config. Should have a fix today."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Good. The Platform Migration is still on track for the Q2 launch. Marcus, make sure the Checkout Service changes are compatible with the new architecture."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Will do. I'll coordinate with Riley on the deployment strategy."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Perfect. Patrick, feel free to shadow Marcus this week to get up to speed on the Checkout Service. Anything blocking anyone? No? Alright, let's get to it."}
