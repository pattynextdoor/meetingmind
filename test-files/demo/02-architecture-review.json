    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Okay, let's walk through the Checkout Service redesign. Marcus, take us through the new architecture. Patrick, this will be a good deep dive for you."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "So the main change is decoupling the payment processing from the cart logic. We're introducing a new Payment Gateway service that handles all the Stripe integration."},
    {"speaker": "Patrick Tumbucon", "text": "How are you handling transaction consistency across the services?"},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Good question. We're using a saga pattern with compensating transactions. If payment fails, we roll back the cart state."},
    {"speaker": "Riley O'Brien", "text": "How does this affect deployment? Can we deploy them independently?"},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Yes, that's the goal. The Payment Gateway will be a separate service. We'll use async messaging for the handoff."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "What about the Auth Service? I know there's been an issue with the Auth Token Refresh Bug."},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Good point. The Auth Token Refresh Bug is still open. When tokens expire during checkout, users get logged out. It's been causing cart abandonment."},
    {"speaker": "Patrick Tumbucon", "text": "I've dealt with this before. Are you using sliding window refresh or absolute expiration?"},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Sliding window, but the issue is coordinating refreshes across microservices. Each service has its own auth middleware."},
    {"speaker": "Riley O'Brien", "text": "That's a priority fix. Patrick, if you want to pair on this, I think your experience would be really valuable."},
    {"speaker": "Patrick Tumbucon", "text": "Happy to. Let's sync after this."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Perfect. Marcus, can you document the auth flow in the ADR and loop Patrick in?"},
    {"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Will do. I'll have the Architecture Decision Record updated by Thursday."},
    {"speaker": "Sam Chen", "text": "Great. This all feeds into the Platform Migration. Let's make sure we're aligned on timelines."}
