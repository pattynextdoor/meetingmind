# Documentation Sync Rule

**CRITICAL**: Every time you make a functional change to the plugin, you MUST update the relevant documentation.

## What Counts as a Functional Change?

- New features or capabilities added
- Existing features modified or removed
- New settings or configuration options
- Changes to user-facing behavior
- New commands or UI elements
- Changes to data structures that affect user experience
- Performance improvements that users should know about
- Breaking changes or migrations

## Documentation That Must Be Updated

### 1. Feature Documentation (`docs/features/`)

### 4. Landing Page (`frontend/`)

**When to update**: Major feature additions or changes to core value proposition

- `frontend/metadata.json` - Site metadata and description

**What to update**:

<p>Value proposition</p>
```

### 5. Demo Scripts (`docs/demos/`)

## Update Checklist

When making a functional change, go through this checklist:

- [ ] **Identify affected features** - What user-facing functionality changed?
- [ ] **Update feature docs** - Does `docs/features/` need updates?
- [ ] **Update user guide** - Do workflows or settings change?
- [ ] **Update Pro docs** - Is this a Pro feature?
- [ ] **Update landing page** - Is this a major feature worth highlighting?
- [ ] **Update demo scripts** - Should this be shown in demos?
- [ ] **Update examples** - Do code examples need updating?
- [ ] **Check for screenshots** - Do any screenshots need updating?

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Feature

**Change**: Added auto-archive for resolved issues

**Documentation updates needed**:
1. ✅ `docs/pro/entity-extraction.md` - Add section on auto-archiving
2. ✅ `docs/guide/settings.md` - Document `issueArchiveDays` setting
3. ✅ `docs/features/entity-extraction.md` - Explain archive behavior
4. ✅ `frontend/App.tsx` - Add to features list if major selling point

### Example 2: Modifying Existing Feature

**Change**: Changed participant note structure (added "Owns" and "Raised Issues" sections)

**Documentation updates needed**:
1. ✅ `docs/features/participants.md` - Update note structure examples
2. ✅ `docs/pro/participant-insights.md` - Explain new sections
3. ✅ `docs/guide/output.md` - Update output format examples
4. ✅ `docs/demos/DEMO-SCRIPT.md` - Update demo expectations

### Example 3: Changing Settings

**Change**: Deprecated `entityUpdatesFolder` setting

**Documentation updates needed**:
1. ✅ `docs/guide/settings.md` - Mark as deprecated, explain migration
2. ✅ `docs/pro/entity-extraction.md` - Explain why updates aren't separate notes
3. ✅ Update any examples that reference this setting

## Documentation Style Guidelines

### Be Specific
❌ Bad: "The plugin creates notes for people"
✅ Good: "MeetingMind automatically creates notes in your People folder for each participant mentioned in a meeting transcript"

### Show Examples
Always include:
- Code examples for technical features
- Markdown examples for note structures
- Screenshots for UI features (when possible)

### Keep It Current
- Remove outdated information immediately
- Don't leave "Coming soon" sections for shipped features
- Update version numbers if mentioned

### Link Between Docs
- Cross-reference related features
- Link to settings documentation
- Link to Pro features from free feature docs

## When NOT to Update Documentation

You can skip documentation updates for:
- Internal refactoring with no user-facing changes
- Bug fixes that restore intended behavior (unless the bug was documented)
- Performance improvements that are transparent to users
- Code style or linting changes
- Test additions or modifications
- Build system changes

## Enforcement

**Before marking a feature complete**:
1. Review the checklist above
2. Update all relevant documentation
3. Verify examples still work
4. Check for broken links

**During code review**:
- Documentation updates should be in the same PR/commit as the feature
- Reviewers should verify documentation completeness

## Quick Reference

| Change Type | Primary Docs to Update |
|-------------|------------------------|
| New feature | `docs/features/`, `docs/guide/`, landing page |
| Settings change | `docs/guide/settings.md` |
| Pro feature | `docs/pro/`, `docs/features/` |
| Output format | `docs/guide/output.md`, feature docs |
| UI/Commands | User guide, feature docs |
| Integration | `docs/features/[integration].md` |
| Breaking change | ALL affected docs + migration guide |

## Remember

**Documentation is part of the feature.** A feature isn't complete until users can understand and use it through documentation.
