## Detailed Feedback by Scene

### Scene 1: The Obsidian Context (10-12 seconds)
**Current:** "You've got your Obsidian vault—projects, people, ideas all connected. But your meetings? They're stuck in Otter or Fireflies, disconnected from everything else."

**Issues:**
- Assumes viewer already uses Obsidian (narrows audience)
- Problem statement is a bit abstract

**Marketing Improvement:**
```
Option A (Broader appeal):
"Every week, you have dozens of meetings. Action items, decisions, insights—all trapped in Otter or Fireflies. MeetingMind brings them into Obsidian, where they actually connect to your knowledge."

Option B (Pain-focused):
"Your meetings are full of valuable insights. But they're stuck in separate tools, disconnected from your notes. MeetingMind fixes that—automatically."
```

**Recommendation:** Lead with the pain point more directly. The Obsidian context can come second.

---

### Scene 2: The First Import (10-12 seconds)
**Current:** Shows import process with "This takes about 10 seconds..."

**Issues:**
- Processing time might feel slow in a demo
- Doesn't emphasize the "automatic" benefit

**Marketing Improvement:**
- **Edit out processing time** (as you noted) OR
- Show it as a "one-click" moment: "One click, and MeetingMind does the rest..."
- Consider showing multiple imports happening quickly (time-lapse effect)

---

### Scene 3: The Connection (20-25 seconds)
**Current:** Shows participant linking and meeting history

**Strengths:** ✅ This is the core value prop—well executed

**Marketing Enhancement:**
- Add text overlay: "🔗 Auto-linked to your vault"
- Emphasize "automatically" more: "Watch—it automatically links..."
- Consider showing a before/after comparison (sparse graph → connected graph)

---

### Scene 4: The AI Value (12-15 seconds)
**Current:** Shows summaries, action items, decisions

**Issues:**
- Doesn't clearly distinguish Free vs Pro features
- Could emphasize "extracted automatically" more

**Marketing Improvement:**
- Add text overlay: "🤖 AI-powered (Pro feature)"
- Show the contrast: "Quick standups get quick summaries. Deep dives get detailed analysis."
- Consider showing the raw transcript briefly to contrast with the structured output

---

### Scene 5: Entity Extraction - The Magic (20-25 seconds)
**Current:** Shows entity folders and notes being created

**Strengths:** ✅ This is the "wow" moment—well positioned

**Marketing Enhancement:**
- **Lead with the magic**: "But here's what makes it powerful—it doesn't just link to existing notes. It creates new ones."
- Show the entity note opening BEFORE explaining what it is (show, don't tell)
- Emphasize the "automatic knowledge graph building" aspect more
- Consider showing the same issue mentioned in multiple meetings to show tracking over time

**Suggested rewrite:**
```
"But here's the magic—MeetingMind doesn't just link to your existing notes. It creates new ones."

[Show entity folder expanding]

"Issues mentioned across different meetings—"

[Click on issue note, show related meetings]

"—get tracked automatically. Same issue, different meetings, all connected."

[Show topic note]

"Topics evolve across meetings. Your knowledge graph builds itself."
```

---

### Scene 5b: The Graph View (12-15 seconds)
**Current:** Shows graph view growing

**Strengths:** ✅ Visual impact is powerful

**Marketing Enhancement:**
- **This should be the climax**—consider moving it later or making it longer
- Add dramatic music swell (in post-production)
- Show the graph BEFORE explaining—let viewers see the visual impact first
- Consider a side-by-side: "Before MeetingMind" (sparse) vs "After" (connected)

**Suggested flow:**
```
"But here's the best part—"

[Switch to graph view, let it sit for 2 seconds]

"Watch your graph grow."

[Pan/zoom slowly]

"Every meeting adds new nodes. Every participant becomes a hub. Every issue, every topic—"

[Zoom out to show full graph]

"—all connected. Your knowledge graph builds itself, visually."
```

---

### Scene 6: The Big Picture (8-10 seconds)
**Current:** Shows vault structure and counts notes

**Issues:**
- Call-to-action is weak (just text overlay)
- Doesn't emphasize the "effortless" aspect

**Marketing Improvement:**
- **Stronger CTA**: "Try MeetingMind free—or upgrade to Pro for AI features"
- Add pricing: "Free core features • $39 Pro (one-time)"
- Consider ending with: "Four meetings. One click each. A complete knowledge graph. That's MeetingMind."

---

## Overall Script Improvements

### 1. Hook (First 3 Seconds)
**Current:** Starts with Obsidian context

**Better Hook Options:**
```
Option A (Problem-first):
"Your meetings are full of insights. But they're stuck in separate tools, disconnected from your notes. MeetingMind fixes that—automatically."

Option B (Benefit-first):
"Stop copy-pasting transcripts. MeetingMind turns your raw meeting transcripts into connected, actionable Obsidian notes—automatically."

Option C (Question):
"What if your meeting transcripts could automatically connect to your knowledge graph? That's MeetingMind."
```

### 2. Value Proposition Clarity
Add a clear value prop early:
- "One-click import from Otter, Fireflies, or any transcript file"
- "AI-powered summaries, action items, and decisions (Pro)"
- "Automatic linking to your existing notes"
- "Builds your knowledge graph automatically"

### 3. Social Proof (If Available)
- "Used by [X] Obsidian users"
- "Featured in [publication]"
- Testimonial quote (if you have one)

### 4. Call-to-Action
**Current:** Text overlay with pricing

**Stronger CTA Options:**
- End with: "Get MeetingMind free in Obsidian Community Plugins. Upgrade to Pro for AI features—$39 one-time."
- Add: "Link in description" (if posting on YouTube/social)
- Consider: "Try it free, then upgrade if you love it"
