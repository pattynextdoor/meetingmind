# Otter.ai Support

Import transcripts from Otter.ai using their export feature.

## How It Works

MeetingMind supports Otter.ai transcripts through their export functionality. Simply export your transcript from Otter and drop it in your watched folder.

## Export Steps

1. **Open your transcript** in Otter.ai
2. **Click the "..." menu** (or Share button)
3. **Select Export**
4. **Choose a format:**
   - **Text (.txt)** - Simple transcript
   - **SRT (.srt)** - Includes timestamps
5. **Save to your watch folder**

MeetingMind will automatically import and process it within seconds.

## Supported Export Formats

| Format | Extension | Features |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Text | `.txt` | Speaker labels, basic text |
| SRT | `.srt` | Timestamps, speaker labels |
| JSON | `.json` | Full metadata (if available) |

## Tips

- **Batch exports**: Export multiple transcripts and drop them all in your watch folder
- **Auto-processing**: Enable AI enrichment to automatically get summaries and action items
- **Reprocess anytime**: Use "MeetingMind: Reprocess current note" to re-run AI on older imports

## Why Not Direct Sync?

Otter.ai's API is currently in closed beta and only available to enterprise customers. The export workflow provides the same functionality without requiring API access.

We're monitoring Otter's API availability and will add direct sync when it becomes publicly available.
